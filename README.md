# Standalone Simple REST example

This is the `rest` example from Graphweaver pulled out as a separate project, as there are some complexities with running examples in the monorepo that people who aren't Graphweaver developers don't need to worry about.

It implements the People endpoint from the [SWAPI.info](https://swapi.info) API.
